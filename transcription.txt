hello I'm Simon Corcoran I'm the founder and creator of the website alt simon.com I've been teaching IELTS for over 16 years and I wrote a Blog lesson almost every day on my website for about 10 years I've also got over a million people following my lessons using my resources across different platforms and websites online and this is a message for students in Vietnam who are preparing for adults to tell you that I've teamed up to work with pastel The Language School in your country I'm working with them exclusively and officially now there are many websites in Vietnam and around the world that have copied my resources and materials for IELTS without my permission you can't trust those websites there are even some language schools have done this you can't trust them either they have had no permission from me and I haven't been involved with helping them to use the materials properly but I am working officially an exclusively with pastel so you can trust them with putting together a unique set of resources and lessons for sale students in Vietnam now just to talk a bit about IELTS and preparation many people are preparing in the wrong way or have the wrong information about IELTS their focusing too much on grammar for example and trying to memorize complex structures that they think will get them high school or they're looking for some tricks or shortcuts to help them to help to improve their schools and these things don't work what you need to do is study and prepare properly and my Approach is based on three main pillars for first we need a method for every aspect of the exam not a secret or a shortcut or a trick a real method of doing the exam that works so I teach a method for every aspect every part of the test the second thing that I would say is essential the second pillar is to improve your English language you need to work on your level of English your particularly your use of vocabulary and the range of vocabulary English words and phrases that you are able to use where flexibly and correctly and finally the third pillar is practice we need to do realistic exam practice and practice exercises so we can use the techniques the methods and the English language that we've been studying and that's how I've been working with pastel to prepare courses that are based on those three pillars so if you're preparing for the test and if you're in Vietnam I highly recommend that you check out puzzles courses so good luck
