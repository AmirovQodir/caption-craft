00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,384
hello I'm Simon Corcoran I'm the founder and creator of

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:08,768
the website alt simon.com I've been teaching IELTS for over

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:13,153
16 years and I wrote a Blog lesson almost every

4
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:17,537
day on my website for about 10 years I've also

5
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:21,922
got over a million people following my lessons using my

6
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:26,306
resources across different platforms and websites online and this is

7
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:30,691
a message for students in Vietnam who are preparing for

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:35,075
adults to tell you that I've teamed up to work

9
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:39,460
with pastel The Language School in your country I'm working

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,844
with them exclusively and officially now there are many websites

11
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:48,228
in Vietnam and around the world that have copied my

12
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:52,613
resources and materials for IELTS without my permission you can't

13
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:56,997
trust those websites there are even some language schools have

14
00:00:56,997 --> 00:01:01,382
done this you can't trust them either they have had

15
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:05,766
no permission from me and I haven't been involved with

16
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:10,151
helping them to use the materials properly but I am

17
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:14,535
working officially an exclusively with pastel so you can trust

18
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:18,920
them with putting together a unique set of resources and

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,304
lessons for sale students in Vietnam now just to talk

20
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:27,688
a bit about IELTS and preparation many people are preparing

21
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,073
in the wrong way or have the wrong information about

22
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:36,457
IELTS their focusing too much on grammar for example and

23
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:40,842
trying to memorize complex structures that they think will get

24
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:45,226
them high school or they're looking for some tricks or

25
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:49,611
shortcuts to help them to help to improve their schools

26
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,995
and these things don't work what you need to do

27
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:58,379
is study and prepare properly and my Approach is based

28
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,764
on three main pillars for first we need a method

29
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:07,148
for every aspect of the exam not a secret or

30
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:11,533
a shortcut or a trick a real method of doing

31
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:15,917
the exam that works so I teach a method for

32
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:20,302
every aspect every part of the test the second thing

33
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:24,686
that I would say is essential the second pillar is

34
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:29,071
to improve your English language you need to work on

35
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:33,455
your level of English your particularly your use of vocabulary

36
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:37,840
and the range of vocabulary English words and phrases that

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,224
you are able to use where flexibly and correctly and

38
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:46,608
finally the third pillar is practice we need to do

39
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:50,993
realistic exam practice and practice exercises so we can use

40
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:55,377
the techniques the methods and the English language that we've

41
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:59,762
been studying and that's how I've been working with pastel

42
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:04,146
to prepare courses that are based on those three pillars

43
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:08,531
so if you're preparing for the test and if you're

44
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,915
in Vietnam I highly recommend that you check out puzzles

45
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:17,300
courses so good luck
